    # --- SIMULATION ---
    # In a real system, you would:
    # 1. Apply more advanced audio processing to `audio_data` (e.g., voice activity detection).
    # 2. Extract specific features (e.g., Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs),
    #    log-mel spectrograms, etc.) using libraries like `librosa`.
    #    Example: `mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio_data, sr=config.SAMPLE_RATE, n_mfcc=40)`
    # 3. If using a deep learning model, these features would be fed into the model
    #    to get the embedding.
    #    Example: `embedding = self.embedding_extractor_model.predict(features_for_model)[0]`

    # For now, we generate a random feature vector to simulate an embedding.
    # This allows the rest of the voice authentication logic to function.
